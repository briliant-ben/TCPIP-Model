"""Pure planning of initial SMT queries for one-step invariant checking.

This module renders Z3 SMT-LIB strings for the exact original safety and
overlap queries of the symbolic checker, plus a nonvacuity witness query and
per-choice safety reductions. It performs no solving: z3.Solver.check(),
z3.Solver.model(), Python Machine/reference evaluation, and any filesystem or
network I/O are prohibited here.

All solver objects are constructed with z3.Solver(); only `add` and `to_smt2`
are invoked, never `check` or `model`. The intended caller is a trusted
process that serializes these plans and later solves them.
